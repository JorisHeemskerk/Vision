=============== MoSCoW ===============

Must have:
- A way to decide wich letter is in a given image.
- Shape Contexts as a feature to recognise letters.
- Documented experiments.
- Documented results and conclusion.

Should have:
- Scale Invariant Feature Transform as a feature to recognise letters.

Could have:
- Maximum Response of filters as a feature to recognise letters.

Wont Have:
- Any simelaritys between my work and Rick Horemans work (same challenge).


============== Planning ==============

Week 1:
- Deciding upon paper.
